### Project Plan for "Jump" URL Shortening Service

#### Project Overview:
The "Jump" project aims to develop a URL shortening service that allows users to shorten long URLs. The service will provide a robust API for URL shortening, user authentication, analytics, and custom short URLs. The GUI development will be deferred to a later stage. The project will follow Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology and use OpenAPI specifications to define the API schema.

#### Objectives:
- Develop a URL shortening service.
- Provide a robust API for URL shortening, user authentication, analytics, and custom short URLs.
- Defer GUI development to a later stage.
- Use TDD methodology.
- Define the API schema using OpenAPI specifications.

#### Target Users:
- General public and businesses.

#### Core Features:
1. **API for URL Shortening**: Develop a comprehensive API for inputting and managing long URLs.
2. **User Authentication**: Integration with GitHub for federated identity authentication.
3. **Analytics**: Track general KPIs such as the number of URLs shortened and user engagement.
4. **Custom Short URLs**: Allow users to create custom short URLs.

#### Technology Stack:
- **Backend**: TypeScript with NestJS framework.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Frontend**: React (deferred).
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions.
- **Deployment**: Kubernetes cluster.
- **Local Development**: Docker.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Grafana and Prometheus (to be integrated towards the end).

#### Security and Compliance:
- Follow general best practices for security, including data encryption and user data protection.

#### UX/UI Design:
- Aim for a clean and simple look and feel (deferred).

#### Performance and Scalability:
- Plan for scalability and performance optimizations as the project progresses.

#### Backup and Recovery:
- Follow best practices for backup and recovery.

#### Timeline:
- Follow an Agile methodology with iterative development and flexibility in the timeline.

#### Budget:
- No specific budget constraints; utilize existing Kubernetes cluster for deployment.

#### Additional Notes:
- No other stakeholders or team members are currently involved.

### Project Phases and Milestones:

#### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- **Task 1.1**: Set up the development environment, including NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Docker.
- **Task 1.2**: Configure GitHub repository and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

#### Phase 2: Define API Schema
- **Task 2.1**: Use OpenAPI specifications to define the API schema for URL shortening, user authentication, analytics, and custom short URLs.

#### Phase 3: API Development with TDD
- **Task 3.1**: Write tests for the core API functionalities based on the OpenAPI specs.
- **Task 3.2**: Develop the core API for URL shortening.
- **Task 3.3**: Implement user authentication via GitHub.
- **Task 3.4**: Add endpoints for analytics and custom short URLs.

#### Phase 4: CI/CD Pipeline
- **Task 4.1**: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
- **Task 4.2**: Automate testing and deployment processes.

#### Phase 5: Deployment
- **Task 5.1**: Deploy the API to the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Task 5.2**: Ensure the deployment is stable and functional.

#### Phase 6: Monitoring and Logging
- **Task 6.1**: Integrate Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring and logging.
- **Task 6.2**: Set up alerts and dashboards for system health and performance.

#### Phase 7: Testing and Optimization
- **Task 7.1**: Conduct thorough testing of the API.
- **Task 7.2**: Optimize the API for performance and scalability.

#### Phase 8: GUI Development (Deferred)
- **Task 8.1**: Develop the GUI for URL input and management.
- **Task 8.2**: Integrate the GUI with the API.

### Project Timeline:
- **Week 1-2**: Initial Setup
- **Week 3-4**: Define API Schema
- **Week 5-8**: API Development with TDD
- **Week 9-10**: CI/CD Pipeline
- **Week 11-12**: Deployment
- **Week 13-14**: Monitoring and Logging
- **Week 15-16**: Testing and Optimization
- **Future Phase**: GUI Development

### Project Management:
- **Methodology**: Agile with iterative development and flexibility in the timeline.
- **Tools**: GitHub for version control, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker for local development, Kubernetes for deployment, Grafana and Prometheus for monitoring and logging.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
- Number of URLs shortened.
- User engagement metrics.
- System performance metrics (e.g., response time, uptime).

### Risk Management:
- **Risk 1**: Delays in development due to unforeseen technical challenges.
  - **Mitigation**: Regular progress reviews and Agile sprints to address issues promptly.
- **Risk 2**: Security vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation**: Follow best practices for security and conduct regular security audits.
- **Risk 3**: Performance bottlenecks.
  - **Mitigation**: Optimize code and infrastructure for scalability and performance.
